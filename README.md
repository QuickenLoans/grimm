# Grimm Framework

This is a Node.js HMVC framework. Right now it's just a placeholder. The framework is mostly
complete, and should be uploaded in a week or two.

The H part means that there are many different MVC folders within the application. Each one
contains its own controller, models, views, and even public directories.
